<h3>More about {{sitename}}</h3>

<p>{{sitename}} is based on <a href="http://elgg.org">ELGG</a>, a
flexible, and fully customizable social networking platform.</p>

<p>Users of {{sitename}} will have a digital repository of artefacts
which can be private or shared within communities. They will have a
weblog which will be able to link to artefacts in the repository
creating a useful bed for reflection. The social networking protocol
will allow users to join up and create a variety of communities. All
elements and artefacts can have access privileges attached determining
who can view them.</p>

<p>It is hoped {{sitename}} will be a fun, useful tool which will
place the people at the center of their digital world.</p>

<p>Join the <a href="http://elgg.org">ELGG</a> community of users

appreciate all feedback and comments so we can continue to develop and
improve the system</p>
