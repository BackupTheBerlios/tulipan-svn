Elgg is designed to be simple to upgrade if you are currently running 0.6 or
above. All you need to do is:

1. Overwrite your Elgg files with the files in this distribution.

2. Overwrite your .htaccess file with the htaccess-dist file found here.

3. Log in as a user with admin privileges (this is usually the news user
on most installations).

4. If Elgg displays any database upgrade messages, click the button at the
bottom of the page to continue.

5. That's it!


PLEASE NOTE: Elgg 0.8 contains integration with the Explode service at
http://ex.plode.us/. From time to time, Elgg will ping Explode to let it know
it exists. If you don't want this to happen, you must delete the folder at
/mod/explodeping.


Users running Elgg 0.4 can upgrade using the same mechanism, but there are known
issues with the file structure. From Elgg 0.6 onwards, all uploaded files and
icons are stored in an Elgg data directory; you will need to define this and
more in config.php by overwriting it with config-dist.php and filling in the
configuration details again before performing steps 2 through 5 above.
